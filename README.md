## Introduction

Brief introduction to your personal website, its purpose, and key features.

## Application of Concepts Taught

I applied all the concepts taught during the course, including:

- **HTML and CSS Basics:** Constructed the structure of the website using HTML and styled it with CSS.
  
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented responsive design using breakpoints, flexbox, and other techniques to ensure a seamless experience across devices.
  
- **Transitions and Animations:** Utilized CSS transitions and animations for a visually appealing and interactive website.
  
- **Selectors and Styles:** Applied various selectors and styles for colors, borders, images, and other elements to enhance the visual aesthetics.
  
- **JavaScript Exploration:** Although JavaScript was introduced late, I conducted research and experimented with basic commands, exploring its potential for future enhancements.

## Design
